# hello-typescript-fp
I'm pairing with ChatGPT to build this repo. Hope it could guide me to finish a comprehensive demo with Jest, Typescript, React, and Functional Programming concepts.
我想要和ChatGPT一起写点代码，看看它能帮我做什么。

### You:
I'm new frontend developer, could you play as an senior developer to guide me

### ChatGPT:
blablabla (without any code lol)

### You:
I want to create a typescript application uses Jest as test lib, and react, could you let me know what's the 1st step to do?

### ChatGPT:
1. npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
2. npm install --save-dev jest @types/jest
3. (it suggests to add `jest.config.js` file, but I didn't follow.)
4. Write some tests: Create a new folder called __tests__ in your src folder, and create some test files inside it. For example, you could create a file called App.test.tsx with the following code:
5. npm test
