I'm pairing with ChatGPT to build this repo. Hope it could guide me to finish a comprehensive demo with Jest, Typescript, React, and Functional Programming concepts.
我想要和ChatGPT一起写点代码，看看它能帮我做什么。

You:
I'm a new front end developer, I want to learn Functional Programming by using Typescript, Jest and React. In the end, I want to build an application which can display a book list in browser with functions to add or remove item from the list. How can I start?

ChatGPT:
blablabla (without any code lol)

You:
At the very beginning, I want to setup a new application, how to do that?

ChatGPT:
1. Install Node.js
2. npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript
3. npm install --save-dev jest @types/jest
4. Add package.json with following: "test": "jest"
5. npm install react-router-dom @types/react-router-dom
6. npm start
